# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on March 15, 2024

## Issue Summary:

- **Duration**: March 15, 2024, 10:00 AM - March 15, 2024, 12:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact**: The primary service experiencing downtime was our e-commerce platform, affecting approximately 70% of users. Users reported inability to access the website and complete transactions.
- **Root Cause**: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to improper routing of incoming traffic to the web servers.

## Timeline:

- **10:00 AM**: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a surge in error rates and latency.
- **10:05 AM**: Engineers began investigating the issue, suspecting a potential problem with the database servers due to recent updates.
- **10:20 AM**: Further investigation revealed no anomalies with the database servers, shifting focus to the load balancer configuration.
- **10:40 AM**: Misleadingly, engineers attempted to roll back recent changes to the database servers but saw no improvement in the service.
- **11:00 AM**: Issue escalated to the infrastructure team as engineers suspected a broader networking issue.
- **11:30 AM**: Close examination of load balancer configurations identified the misconfiguration leading to improper routing.
- **12:00 PM**: Load balancer configuration corrected, restoring normal service functionality.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

- **Root Cause**: The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing incorrect routing of incoming traffic. This misconfiguration likely occurred during recent updates to the networking infrastructure.
  
- **Resolution**: The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration to ensure proper routing of incoming traffic to the web servers. Additionally, thorough checks were conducted to verify the integrity of other networking configurations.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- **Improvements/Fixes**:
  - Implement automated configuration checks for load balancers to detect misconfigurations promptly.
  - Enhance monitoring capabilities to provide more granular insights into network traffic and routing.
  - Establish a rollback plan for load balancer configurations to quickly revert changes in case of issues.
  
- **Tasks to Address the Issue**:
  1. Implement automated load balancer configuration checks using configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Terraform).
  2. Enhance network monitoring tools to track traffic patterns and detect anomalies in real-time.
  3. Develop and document a rollback procedure for load balancer configurations.
  4. Conduct a comprehensive review of recent infrastructure changes to identify any other potential misconfigurations.
  5. Schedule regular training sessions for engineering teams to increase awareness of network configuration best practices and troubleshooting techniques.
